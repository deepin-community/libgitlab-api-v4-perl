  note: |
    The API authentication token (L</private_token> or L</access_token>
    parameters in a constructor) is not needed when using this method, however
    You must pass trigger token (generated at the trigger creation) as C<token>
    field and git ref name as C<ref> field in the C<%params> hash. You can also
    pass variables to be set in a pipeline in the C<variables> field. Example:

        my $pipeline = $api->trigger_pipeline(
            $project_id,
            {
                token => 'd69dba9162ab6ac72fa0993496286ada',
                'ref' => 'master',
                variables => {
                    variable1 => 'value1',
                    variable2 => 'value2',
                },
            },
        );
